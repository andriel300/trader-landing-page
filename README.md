# All the style guides are from Odin Project

Starting a new fun! Project! In this one, we will start with nothing and build out a Odin Project from scratch. As a student from the Odin Project, I was ready to look at potential problems I could run into and how I would tackle them.

Srsly... This Project has those problems where it looks like they are impossible to solve. As someone who's still busy learning programming, making a website is one of the few basics I suck at.

I didn't use javascript, I only use HTML/CSS. These js files are from Vite because I used 'npm create vite@latest' to install some build in tools to provide a faster and leaner development experience for this web project, I actually did'nt need though... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
